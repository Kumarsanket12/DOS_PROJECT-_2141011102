Project Description 1:
The C program provides an interface to the user to implement the following scheduling policies as per the choice provided:
1. First Come First Served (FCFS)
2. Round Robin (RR)
Appropriate option needs to be chosen from a switch case based menu driven program with an option of “Exit from program” in case 5 and accordingly a scheduling policy will print the Gantt chart and the average waiting time, average turnaround time and average response time. The program will take Process ids, its arrival time, and its CPU burst time as input. For implementing RR scheduling, user also needs to specify the time quantum. Assume that the process ids should be unique for all processes. Each process consists of a single CPU burst (no I/O bursts), and processes are listed in order of their arrival time. Further assume that an interrupted process gets placed at the back of the Ready queue, and a newly arrived process gets placed at the back of the Ready queue as well.
Explains how the First-come-First-Served(FCFS) and Round-Robin(RR) algortithm works in the operating system of our CPU to provide us with multitasking needs and smooth experience.



Project Description 2:
The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for
safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources,
then makes an state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.
